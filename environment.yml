# package dependencies should be in setup.cfg instead
# package will be installed locally with pip -e and afterwards can be treated as any other package
# if you change something in the package's code you don't have to install the package again
# that's because locally the code is accessed directly from the source
# put all pinned package dependencies (with exact versions) in requirements.txt for reproducible environments
