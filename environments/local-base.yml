# add all direct development time conda packages here
# package will be installed locally with pip -e and afterwards can be treated as any other package
# if you change something in the package's code you don't have to install the package again
# that's because locally the code is accessed directly from the source
# then you can use utils/conda-lock.py to create local.yml with all (even indirect) dependencies pinned
# also if you put dependencies without version here utils/conda-lock.py will act as env updater
