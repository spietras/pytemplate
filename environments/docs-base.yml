# provide default environment name
name: pytemplate-docs

# conda-forge used only if packages not found in defaults
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge

# add all direct docs time conda packages here
# as you can see we only need the mkdocs package
# that's because no code needs to run, only the docs files are accessed
# you can use utils/conda-lock.py to create docs.yml with all (even indirect) dependencies pinned
# also if you put dependencies without version here utils/conda-lock.py will act as env updater
dependencies:
  # env dependencies
  - python
  - mkdocs-material
