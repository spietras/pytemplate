# conda-forge used only if packages not found in defaults
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge

# package dependencies should be in setup.cfg instead
# package will be installed with pip and afterwards can be treated as any other package
# if you change something in the package's code you have to install the package again
# that's because you shouldn't modify anything at deploy time
# you can use utils/conda-lock.py to create deploy.yml with all (even indirect) dependencies pinned
# also if you put dependencies without version here utils/conda-lock.py will act as env updater
# package dependencies should be in requirements.txt instead
dependencies:
  - python
