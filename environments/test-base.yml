# add all direct test time conda packages here
# package will be installed with pip and afterwards can be treated as any other package
# if you change something in the package's code you have to install the package again
# that's because you shouldn't modify anything at test time
# you can use utils/conda-lock.py to create test.yml with all (even indirect) dependencies pinned
# also if you put dependencies without version here utils/conda-lock.py will act as env updater
